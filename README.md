The code runs on basic scikit-learn in python. To install the necessary packages (which you probably already have), you can use the environment.yml to instantiate it in "conda".

The data is stored in the ./data folder, and each of the five algorithms is implemented in ./algs , with symbolic links pointing to the data in .csv format. Running the code will randomly sample the dataset and generate new graphs for various metrics, a single run of which is included in the writeup.
